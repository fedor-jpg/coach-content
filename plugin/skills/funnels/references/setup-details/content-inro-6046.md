# Grow your TikTok: link without a help branch

Setup 1.1.0 | content-inro-6046 | adaptation_draft_requires_consent | runtime not tested

## Business Result
Bring Instagram interest to your video, podcast or another channel.
Creators distributing existing YouTube, TikTok or podcast content.
Source entry: tiktok comment or direct message
Source outcome: A TikTok link without verifying a follow
Source requirements: Press the opening button; Wait 3 seconds; Remind if the link is not clicked
Source timing: Before link: 3 seconds; no click or opening button: 3 days.

## Functional Availability
adaptation_draft_requires_consent
The primary job can be prepared with the explicit reply/text substitutions below; this is not a full reproduction or a runtime test.
Primary result: Deliver the TikTok playlist link after confirmation.
Retained/replaced: Deliver the TikTok playlist link after confirmation.
Retained/replaced: URL buttons become readable URLs; confirmation and help controls become actual user replies.
Not retained: Exact source timing is not retained: Before link: 3 seconds; no click or opening button: 3 days.. No timed unsolicited message is configured.
Not retained: No click tracking, click-dependent branch or no-click reminder.
Not retained: No imported deterministic graph or source folder/tag tracking.
Source fidelity and adaptation readiness are separate. Do not bypass a mandatory original gate by selecting an old analogue silently.

## Shared Setup Procedure
Read [setup-policy.md](../setup-policy.md) for read/prepare/approve/configure/readback/edit/return/stop. It takes precedence over old native-policy and GraphQL instructions. No writes or tests are authorized here.

## Selected Preparation
- buttons: Normal reply inputs expose text modes, not rich buttons, callbacks, quick replies or galleries.
- timers: messageDelays is dashboard-only for the normal profile; exact per-step delays and expiration branches are not exposed. Generic followUps is not an exact timer.
- click: No URL-click/no-click conditions or click-triggered actions in normal inputs.
- graph: Full deterministic flow-builder graphs and arbitrary folder/tag/field branches are dashboard-only, not graph import through normal MCP.
### Selected-post comment entry
Choose this entry only; do not configure all alternatives. New matching {keyword} comment on the selected post; continuation only after a verified linked actual reply.
Entry change: Source entry retained. UI controls use actual replies or plain URLs; no source-specific entry is silently substituted.
Output: Deliver the TikTok playlist link after confirmation.
Target: owned_comment
Ask only for missing business facts:
- playlist_title: Supply the business value and approve its use in this selected draft. (required)
- playlist_url: Supply the business value and approve its use in this selected draft. (required)
Assistant-derived, not questionnaire fields: campaign, language, keyword, public_text. Propose naming, entry words and complete copy; infer language. Resolve technical attributes/IDs from tools and hold unresolved writes. Ask approval of the completed draft.
#### Preparation Gates
- Before staging an owned OFF custom, complete readback must equal approved posts, keywords and match mode. Reply-setting updates cannot change filters. A mismatch blocks staging; setup_comment_replies needs separate immediate-enabled approval.
#### Copy and Conversation Instructions
initial: Want {playlist_title}? Reply YES and I will send it.
public: {public_text}
refusal: Understood. I will stop this request.
delivery: Here is {playlist_title}: {playlist_url}
Wait for an actual affirmative reply before delivering: Here is {playlist_title}: {playlist_url} On bare HELP ask what assistance is needed. For an actual question, answer only approved facts; otherwise state that human review is needed without promising an unconfigured handoff. Do not repeat the help invitation. Do not infer confirmation from a comment, silence, button click or URL visit. Do not resend the opener.

Contact rule: No contact capture in this plan.
#### Intended Alternative Branches (Instructions, Not Imported Flow)
- entry: New matching {keyword} comment on the selected post; continuation only after a verified linked actual reply.
  - If Selected entry received -> first
- first: Ask for an actual affirmative reply; no link yet.
  - If Actual affirmative reply in this conversation -> delivery
  - If Actual refusal -> refusal
  - If No actual reply -> silence
- delivery: Deliver the approved destination and included help together.
- refusal: End this request without delivering gated content.
- silence: No message after silence.
#### Exact Setting Drafts
Not tool calls. Add resolved botID/automationID and privacy-safe context only after all gates; one setting per call.

### Direct-message entry
Choose this entry only; do not configure all alternatives. New ordinary DM matching {keyword}; subsequent messages must belong to this campaign in the current conversation.
Entry change: Source entry retained. UI controls use actual replies or plain URLs; no source-specific entry is silently substituted.
Output: Deliver the TikTok playlist link after confirmation.
Target: dm_base
Ask only for missing business facts:
- playlist_title: Supply the business value and approve its use in this selected draft. (required)
- playlist_url: Supply the business value and approve its use in this selected draft. (required)
Assistant-derived, not questionnaire fields: campaign, language, keyword, public_text. Propose naming, entry words and complete copy; infer language. Resolve technical attributes/IDs from tools and hold unresolved writes. Ask approval of the completed draft.
#### Preparation Gates
- Preserve current whenAIReplies and followUps values, including inheritance, on the shared DM base. If its schedule or active follow-ups conflict with the proposed behavior, hold affected configuration or obtain separate approval for the exact base-wide change. No schedule/follow-up write is a default draft operation.

initial: Want {playlist_title}? Reply YES and I will send it.
refusal: Understood. I will stop this request.
delivery: Here is {playlist_title}: {playlist_url}

## Binding And Evidence
Profile: normal-mcp; observation 2026-11-02, revision 2026-11-02.3. Recheck after 2026-11-09 and before every write.
This is deterministic local authoring/rehearsal evidence, not an independent chat, connector test, delivery or live acceptance.
Structured audit: [setup record](content-inro-6046.json). Source changes and capability changes invalidate generated references; they never change live campaigns.
