# Giveaway entry: tag, follow and email

Setup 1.1.0 | giveaway-inro-6018 | waiting_for_chatfuel | runtime not tested

## Business Result
Invite participation and apply the giveaway rules before confirming an entry.
Businesses running a campaign with clear eligibility and prize rules.
Source entry: Comment tagging another person
Source outcome: An eligible entrant, not a selected winner
Source requirements: Verify the tag; Verify a follow; Require email
Source timing: Email: 20 hours; follow: 24 hours.

## Functional Availability
waiting_for_chatfuel
The promised resource, coupon or eligibility depends on a verified Instagram follow. Ordinary MCP cannot check follower status; unconditional delivery would remove the gate.
Primary result: An eligible entrant, not a selected winner
Source fidelity and adaptation readiness are separate. Do not bypass a mandatory original gate by selecting an old analogue silently.

## Shared Setup Procedure
Read [setup-policy.md](../setup-policy.md) for read/prepare/approve/configure/readback/edit/return/stop. It takes precedence over old native-policy and GraphQL instructions. No writes or tests are authorized here.

## Selected Preparation
SETUP DISABLED. Originals below are reference only. Do not generate setting payloads or fall back to historical recipes. A different ordinary-DM scenario is not this scenario. Stop at the named capability or source-evidence dependency.
- follower: No Instagram follower condition or follow/check/retry gate in normal tool inputs.
- buttons: Normal reply inputs expose text modes, not rich buttons, callbacks, quick replies or galleries.
- timers: messageDelays is dashboard-only for the normal profile; exact per-step delays and expiration branches are not exposed. Generic followUps is not an exact timer.
- graph: Full deterministic flow-builder graphs and arbitrary folder/tag/field branches are dashboard-only, not graph import through normal MCP.

## Complete Captured Topology
Nodes below are not an ordered conversation. Follow only the listed outgoing edges. Empty exits remain unknown. Field phases distinguish defaults, inspection variants and current clone state.
### inro-6018: Run a giveaway that grows your reach
Full captured settings/provenance: [selected source JSON](../source-records/inro-6018.json). Start: n000.
#### n000 (trigger)
Read the actual captured entry. Post/comment configuration is not Story, Live, ad or referral configuration.
Business input: entry word and selected post or invitation placement
Setting candidate: No direct normal-MCP setting
Disposition: documented_primitive_not_graph_equivalence; dependencies: comment
Captured text (not approved outbound copy):
```text

Someone comments on your post
SELECT THE POSTS
Next post only
FILTER THE COMMENTS
Comments that tag someone
```
- Edge e000: n000 -> n001 | condition/label: ""

A fixed public reply is a documented primitive, not proof of captured random text choice or downstream routing.
Business input: approved public reply
Setting candidate: update_automation_setting: publicReply
Disposition: documented_primitive_not_graph_equivalence; dependencies: comment

Profile: normal-mcp; observation 2026-11-02, revision 2026-11-02.3. Recheck after 2026-11-09 and before every write.
This is deterministic local authoring/rehearsal evidence, not an independent chat, connector test, delivery or live acceptance.
